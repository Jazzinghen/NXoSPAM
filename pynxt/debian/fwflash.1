.SH NAME
fwflash \- Flash a Lego Mindstorms NXT firmware
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fwflash
.I file
.BR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fwflash
is a program that takes a firmware image for the Lego Mindstorms NXT and
writes it to the flash memory of a brick connected to the computer by
its USB cable.
.PP
The Lego Mindstorms NXT brick should be put into reset mode (also known
as "clicking brick" mode) by pressing the button hidden in the top-left
whole of its underside.
.PP
Note that
.B fwflash
does not validate the contents of the firmware image (how could it?). It
only checks that the firmware image is smaller than 256kB, ensuring that
it can fit into the NXT's flash memory.
.PP
Once the firmware has been written to the NXT,
.B fwflash
automatically passes control to the firmware, meaning that your brick
should immediately boot the newly written firmware.
.SH OPTIONS
